	<h1>Hey, I&rsquo;m Mike. Nice to Meet You!</h1>
	<p>Hello, I&rsquo;m Mike Jeffery, and I want us to have nice things. I design and build user-friendly, accessible interfaces for the web â€” blending thoughtful design with clean, functional code. I&rsquo;m passionate about making the web a better place for everyone. Right now, I&rsquo;m deep-diving into design systems.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I&rsquo;m a proud dad. My partner and I are raising two incredible kids in North Reading, MA, where we spend as much time exploring and making memories as we can.</p>
	<p>Some things I love: punk, ska, reggae, and weird video games. One thing I don&rsquo;t: fascism.</p>
