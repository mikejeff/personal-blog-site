I have wanted to start writing for a long time now. I’ve been a developer for about ten years; professionally, something like eight. Throughout this journey, I’ve read blogs of people I admire and trust. I believe I’m trustworthy, and intend to be a developer that others can rely on to give a hand coming up the ladder.

I am going to push myself to do this. I want to become a better writer. I want to become a better researcher. As [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/) puts it, “Writing helps *me* think.” I think writing about what I'm working on and reading about is going to help me find flaws in my thinking, new angles to explore, and find the words I need to speak about concepts in a way that makes sense to people other than me. I hope others find value in what I have to offer, but I can’t worry if they don’t. I need to do this for me. This is the spot where I can see my own progress as a developer and a writer.

After coping for most of my adult life, this year, I sought out a diagnosis for my ADHD. Over the years, it built up to a point where I had to make a change. After a day’s work, I’d be way too drained to play with my kids let alone maintain a website and write on a regular basis. Since starting on medication, I am sharper and more patient than ever. I feel that I have the mental bandwidth to do this.

I'll close this one with a lovely quote from Gandalf the Grey in *The Lord of the Rings*: “A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.” I assure you I am no wizard, but because I didn't start this project ten years ago doesn't mean I'm late. Time to focus on the here and now&hellip; and the future.

If you're here for this, come hit me up on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/fellaroonie.bsky.social). I'd love to hear from you!
